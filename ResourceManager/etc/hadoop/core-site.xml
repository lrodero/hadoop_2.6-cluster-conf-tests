    <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
    <value>hfds://localhost:50050/</value>
    <description>
      Default URI for all filesystem requests in Hadoop. Thus, for
      example, when requesting
      $ hdfs dfs -ls /
      will list the contents of the local filesystem instead of some
      HDFS system. For that, you would
      $ hdfs dfs -ls hdfs://localhost:50050
      where localhost:50050 is set as dfs.namenode.rpc-address in the
      hdfs-site.xml config file of the NameNode. Another option is to
      set this fs.defaultFS paremeter with that hdfs address, but
      I find it a bit messy.
